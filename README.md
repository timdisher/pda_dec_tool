# NMA Decision Tool  
  
The purpose of this project is to use Souvik's JAMA paper as an example of an implementation of a simple MCDA tool based on a combination of absolute rates + relative reduction with uncertainty estimated from the summary data provided as output from NMAs. The target journal of medical decision making.  
  
The general thesis of the paper will be:  
1. Many medical decisions require weighting of multiple outcomes  
2. This is typically done ad-hoc, but there are some neat MCDA applications  
3. Current MCDA applications are either not correct (based on SUCRA) or complex (Gert papers).  
4. We want to create something that is easy for clinicians to use to help make a decision
