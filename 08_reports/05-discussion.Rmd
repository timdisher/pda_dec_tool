# Discussion  
- Provide a brief synopsis of key findings with particular emphasis on how the findings add to the body of pertinent knowledge.  
- Discuss possible mechanisms and explanations for the findings.  
- Compare study results with relevant findings from other published work.  
- Discuss the limitations of the study and any methods used to minimize or compensate for those limitations.  
- Mention any crucial future research directions.  
- Summarize in a straightforward and circumspect manner the clinical implications of the work.  
- Limitations  
    - Ibuprophen high dose oral only ever in three trials max.  
    - Implication is that despite the large N, you're really making a decision based on those three trials.  
    - This might be a great case for stronger priors... future work should look at simulations of these situations. Re-analysis outside the scope of this paper though.
    - Really should be multivariate
